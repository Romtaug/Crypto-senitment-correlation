Schiff, known for his anti-Bitcoin stance, said that with the launch of a Bitcoin ETF, many of the current onlookers will have already invested in the cryptocurrency. As these early adopters aim to capitalize on their investments through sales, Schiff anticipates a shortage of buyers for the ETF, potentially resulting in a market crash. Mad Money show host Jim Cramer considers the decline in the pric4 of BTC a “nasty beginning to the sell-off “Someone's probably going to try to make a stand here but as we said last night you can't have an asset double in value by hundreds of billions of dollars in anticipation of an ETF and then almost no one shows up,” Cramer explained.

What’s more, there are reasons to believe that Bitcoin’s upcoming halving and Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin ETF will drive the world's first and most famous cryptocurrency much higher. Standard Chartered expects BTC to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. So, what’s the safest and easiest way to get a piece of this pie? **Ways to trade crypto** Before you start trading, make sure that you understand that Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates independently of any central bank. It's known for its volatility, which can lead to high profits and significant risks. & https://preview.redd.it/iobjpyyvxbec1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e6d19dc1c67133865d6d8c9ca773c950b36fd99 Now that we're done with the warnings, let’s get to the practical part. Here are some ways to trade BTC: 1.
01-24-24 07:10	Olymp_ads	6.08	4.31	* **Forex** – in this mode, you can open and close trades whenever you feel like it, either manually or by using Take Profit and Stop Loss tools. & https://preview.redd.it/8ssii2a3ybec1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=f04b4aa0e418a3f02951cb4222b21cabd7145414 On platforms that allow trading without owning, you can analyze the charts, figure out the current BTC trend, and find chart patterns that will help you enter and exit the market at the right time. You can plan your trades and manage your trading results instead of worrying about the safety of your coins in the exchanges or wallets. You also have an opportunity to practice on a demo account before investing any real money. & https://preview.redd.it/srpudn46ybec1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ac7b2adf6f1bc527724ae58947d1158bb7cdac6 So, these are the ways of trading BTC.
01-24-24 07:10	Olymp_ads	5.80	4.23	The disadvantage here is that derivatives can be complicated for beginners and involve a higher risk due to leverage and market complexity. **Trading without owning** There’s one more way to become exposed to BTC and earn on its price swings. Online trading platforms like Olymp Trade enable traders to speculate on price movements without owning any actual Bitcoins. With online trading, you can make a deposit in fiat or crypto and then start trading Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in two modes: * **Fixed Time Trades** – in this mode, you can make trades with a pre-set duration, like 1, 5, 10, 30 minutes or longer.

BTC Future Trends and Potential Opportunities: Despite the current market fluctuations, there is a general optimism about the future trend of BTC, with expectations of continued overall growth. In the quest for investment opportunities, attention is turning to the Layer 2 scalability of BTC. As the BTC ecosystem's barriers rise, scalability and reduced fees become imperative. Notably, the recently spotlighted SAVM project is considered a major player in 2024, with many already earning millions by selling SAVM. The success of this project underscores the innovative vigor in the BTCspace, presenting new opportunities for BTC Layer2 scalability. 3.

I excused Craig’s problematic behaviors, as he fit the role of an anti-hero deconstructing our dystopia of a society.

I have no doubt in my mind the average BSV end-user fights much harder for BSV than the average BTC end-user fights for BTC.

However, the market is now filled with various cryptocurrency options, with bitcoin being just one of them. One of the alternatives to the popular founding cryptocurrency is Litecoin. So, should you buy Litecoin? Despite the supremacy of BTC, the alternatives, such as Litecoin, are gaining popularity for various reasons. For example, Litecoin is much more affordable than bitcoin, which means it is easier to buy. And, if you’re [crypto gambling](https://reddit.com/r/cryptocasino) at the [best crypto casino](https://reddit.com/r/cryptocasino), taking a loss won’t be as tough on the pocket.

At the end of 2024, they expect the price to be an average of $307.65. * Digital Coin Price, which uses historical analysis, expects the currency to peak at around $135 at the end of 2021 and increase in 2022. While none of these is as strong as BTC, and maybe even some other cryptocurrencies, the outlook is still generally positive and indicates that it might be a good idea to buy Litecoin. ## Pros and Cons Of Buying Litecoin Here are some pros and cons of investing in this cryptocurrency to make it easier to decide if you want to buy Litecoin.
01-26-24 10:58	jellyfishezie	6.13	4.20	In addition, many of the newer alternatives were developed in response to issues found within BTC, meaning that they don’t have these issues themselves. With this information alone, you may jump at the opportunity to buy Litecoin. But don’t do it just yet. First, read on to learn more about cryptocurrency to be sure you want to go for it. ## LTC Currency Overview Before considering whether you should buy Litecoin, let’s dive into what it is. The cryptocurrency was one of the first to enter the market after bitcoin, with its initial launch in 2011, just two years after BTC came into existence. Since then, it has become tremendously well-known and sought after and can be found on every crypto exchange.  Like almost all other currencies, LTC uses blockchain technology to run on, ensuring that it is decentralised. ### A Short History Of Litecoin As we mentioned, Litecoin came into existence in 2011, in October of that year, to be specific.
01-26-24 10:58	jellyfishezie	6.16	4.19	It has also made BTC mining inaccessible to individual miners, who must join a mining pool if they hope to mine the crypto successfully.  Mining LTC is still very much accessible to the everyday miner. It means getting your hands on it easier if you’re a miner. This is not the case with Litecoin and Scrypt. ### 3. Total Coins As we all know, the maximum BTC that can exist is 21 million. LTC, on the other hand, maxes out at 84 million.  This sounds like an advantage to the latter. However, it is mostly psychological. Because there are more coins to be mined, it seems like there is more to go around, so more people can buy and use it. However, it just brings down the value as more gets created. This is based on the basic supply and demand principle.  On top of all this, a low price doesn’t mean much since you don’t have to buy one whole bitcoin. So, you could spend the amount you would have to buy one Litecoin to purchase a fraction of a BTC.
01-26-24 10:58	jellyfishezie	6.02	4.18	It began when Charlie Lee, a former employee of Google and follower of Bitcoin, published the newer cryptocurrency’s whitepaper.  Essentially, Lee thought that BTC was valuable. However, he thought it would be better if improvements were made in various aspects. His improvements to the cryptocurrency centred around the time transactions take (he wanted the times to be reduced), fees, and the mitigation of mining pools. After two years in the market, Litecoin achieved a $1 billion market capitalisation. Today, it is still one of the strongest crypto options.  https://preview.redd.it/pnnc3vw0crec1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b23c7d693b9966b17c6bbfc8804669e89bd4b2 ## How Does The Currency Work? Litecoin Compared To Bitcoin Since the currency is based on bettering BTC, it functions similarly to its predecessor.
01-26-24 10:58	jellyfishezie	6.04	4.12	https://preview.redd.it/b51rnlo2crec1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=11026c99fe905998d1bd5245173eee5bf89a5f0f ## Is It A Good Investment To Buy Litecoin? Now that you know LTCs’ differences from the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and you probably already have a bit of a grasp on which one you prefer, we can dig into investing in Litecoin.  Well-known investors are supporting cryptocurrency, insisting that it should be considered a strong player in the crypto market and that its price has the potential to grow much more in the long term. LTC is currently one of the largest cryptos concerning market cap. Based on this alone, many believe this cryptocurrency is worth investing in this year. As of writing (Jan 2021), Litecoin is priced at $141.11 with a 24-hour trading volume of $14,689,580,045. Of course, this can’t compare to the ever-powerful BTC, but it does show the currency’s potential when we look at the change in price since last year. The currency is down 18.
01-26-24 10:58	jellyfishezie	5.89	4.08	However, there are a few modifications in the areas where Lee thought it was necessary. Understanding these differences may help you decide whether you want to buy Litecoin. Here are three of the main differences: 1. **Transaction Speed** One of the reasons behind the popularity of Litecoin is the increased transaction speed (in comparison to BTC). On average, a transaction on the BTC network takes around 9 minutes to be confirmed by miners. On the Litecoin network, however, the same task takes around 2.5 minutes to complete. ### 2. Mining The difference is actually in the algorithms used to mine the two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, and Litecoin uses Scrypt. The former is much more complicated than the latter, and thus BTC is more difficult to mine.  In practice, this has led many miners to use increasingly sophisticated methods of mining BTC.
01-26-24 10:59	jellyfishezie	5.97	4.39	Before its creation, Ethereum successfully launched an initial coin offering (ICO), which is much like initial public offerings, but for the funding of alternative types of cryptocurrency. This was so popular that it has fostered an ICO trend amongst crypto start-ups. Ethereum may have risen to second place behind Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization, but the gap between the two is massive. One token of ether, which is the name of Ethereum’s currency, is only a fraction of the worth of a BTC. This is primarily due to the latter’s first-mover advantage in the market. The pre-sale of its coins, however, injected huge capital into Ethereum, boosting it to a prominent position in the crypto pantheon.

01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	6.32	4.62	This is because regulations have increased the authorities’ trust in cryptocurrencies, leading to an expansion. ### The Currency Is Available For Free People who don’t understand the mining process have the misconception that bitcoin is distributed freely. It is mined in a computing resource-intensive method that validates transitions through blockchains. These are ledgers of the previous transaction history. The miners who process and provide verification of transactions are then rewarded with bitcoin as fees paid for mining. Like any other fiat currency, it costs money to make money, and BTC is no different. ### It Cannot Be Used For Point Of Sale Transactions It is possible to use bitcoin for point-of-sale transactions, although the verification process can take up to an hour. This is to safeguard the owner of the crypto from not double spending on a single transaction.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	5.68	4.60	Crypto businesses and banks today have compliance teams that have successfully used these tools and resources to understand the different types of digital crime better. This is especially helpful in identifying the risk to their institutions, safeguarding themselves, and remaining compliant. The use of bitcoin for illegal activities is no more than any traditional fiat currency. Compared to currencies such as the US Dollar, BTC is used far less often for illegal activities. ### Bitcoin Facilitates Tax Evasion In looking at the truth about bitcoin, users agree that transacting with the currency can be likened to transacting in cash, and those transactions eventually get taxed successfully.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	6.20	4.57	While trading pioneers enjoyed superb returns, these were not at the expense of the traders who joined the party later. Bitcoin is not controlled by any investment company, does not have central authority managing processes, and does not have a regulatory body that controls production or consumption on the blockchain. It can be generated by anyone using the blockchain system, and the individual is at liberty to buy or sell any number of bitcoins at any given time with a centralised authority to report to. https://preview.redd.it/tln0emkjc2fc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=363e2e99900df43a600eee0dca457d42447b54ba ### New BTC Will Not Be Generated Once 21 Million Have Been Mined Although no more BTC can be generated after 21 million have been mined, the network will still need to be protected.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	5.62	4.53	Using a sophisticated blockchain system makes it almost impossible for unscrupulous elements to access a person’s personal information and exploit them to steal their funds. https://preview.redd.it/jei0jx8mc2fc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d963a6060d598bccbf8a592541af2c386c77ec2c ### Bitcoin Consumes Too Much Energy While traditional financial institutions use energy to deliver services to clients and manage staff, transportation, back-office services, and security protocols, BTC uses significantly less energy for its operations.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	5.61	4.49	However, e-commerce traders who transact in Bitcoin don’t mind waiting for their transaction verification, as this ensures that they have not committed to a double-spend for their purchase. Vendors can mitigate this further as they can also accept unconfirmed transactions by listening on the network or using a company to avoid double-spend transactions. This process is quick and efficient and vastly reduces the wait time. ### BTC Is A Massive Ponzi Scheme A Ponzi scheme can be described as a type of fraud that pays an investor returns with funds derived from newer investors instead of using funds derived from profit. The truth about bitcoin is that it is an open-source, peer-to-peer currency, and there is no central authority to direct such an elaborate scheme.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	5.46	4.36	* **Durability**: Since it is stored on decentralised networks, it ensures durability provided those decentralised networks remain active. * **Divisibility**: You are not forced to buy an entire BTC and are entitled to purchase it in fractions to suit your pocket. ### Bitcoin Is Illegal https://preview.redd.it/hmtuk9zgc2fc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=037727457e76f6f86dac8f2a132fe62c53e1cf4a Many people are apprehensive about bitcoin as they are under the impression that it isn’t legal tender. Legal tender in the US consists of bills and coins issued by the government. This does not, however, render the crypto illegal because the government classifies it as a virtual currency. The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also recognises it.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	5.80	4.23	In light of this, Law Enforcement has an avenue of tracing transactions and identifying the owner of a specific address. This is intended to mitigate illegal activity on the decentralised network. ### Bitcoin Is Expensive Bitcoin’s exchange value is thousands of US dollars for a single token. Although that may be the case, users can purchase fractions of one to suit their pocket. Similar to fiat currency exchanges, BTC can be exchanged in fractions. A smaller unit of a bitcoin is referred to as Satoshi. Traders who want to trade in the crypto are free to use Satoshi on the platform. ### It Is A Volatile Currency Markets often behave in patterns of fluctuation where commodities fall and rise in trends. Bitcoin has, however, shown remarkable stability since its introduction, which explains its exponential growth.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	6.24	4.13	In terms of bitcoin’s value, it is based on supply and demand. Judging by the growing use of this currency, its value is undoubtedly growing. While fiat currencies depend on the support fixed by governments, BTC is limited in supply and cannot be manipulated. Crypto fits all the attributes associated with money, and its value is growing exponentially with the increasing number of users it attracts. These attributes include: * **Acceptability**: an increasing number of merchants globally accept BTC and other cryptocurrencies to trade. * **Scarcity**: A currency will grow in value when it is in limited supply. Since only 21 million bitcoins will ever be mined, this limited supply will ensure its value doesn’t diminish. * **Interchangeable**: The currency can be traded against other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. * **Transferability**: Bitcoin is powered by blockchain technology, facilitating a quick, easy, and cost-effective way to transfer funds internationally.
01-27-24 12:00	jellyfishezie	6.05	4.10	Despite incentives for mining weakening, generating new blocks is important to provide the publicly available, network-distributed ledger of transactions. The blockchain will not be stagnant as profit can still be attained through transaction fees. Moreover, the demand for security will diminish once the reward for mining no longer exists. ### Bitcoin Is Easily Hacked One of the most common bitcoin myths is that it can be hacked, and funds in the network are insecure. Although vulnerabilities in the network include wallet security and occasional attacks on bitcoin-friendly websites, none of these occurrences on the blockchain has led to funds being stolen, protocol exploitation, or inadequacies with the original BTC client.

Moreover, traders must divulge their details for record purposes when they need to use exchange services. This ensures that there is indeed a paper trail of BTC users within this decentralised network. As opposed to being anonymous, it can be thought of as pseudo-anonymous. Transactions of all types are stored on the public blockchain along with the address of those specific wallet types used. Despite no identifying personal information being displayed on the blockchain ledger, all one would need to do is to ascertain the owner of a specific digital wallet to discover the individual responsible for transactions from that address.

01-28-24 02:29	ASingleGuitarString	5.84	4.49	Things were going well until the price dropped to the 30 degree line on January 3rd due to FUD from a supposed leak stating the BTC ETF would get denied. The ETF was approved and prices went back up and surprisingly after a correction came back in line with the 35 degree line. that is, up until January 21st when ETH price tanked from the mid 2400s to the mid 2200s where it sits now landing right on the 20 degree line. I believe this to have been caused by a few things. One being the hype from speculation of ETH ETFs fizzling away. Lets not forget Celsius is getting ready to liquidate about $125M worth of ETH. Lots of people anticipated a dump. I call it a healthy correction and prices managed to find support above crucial price levels which to me is a good sign for a quick recovery.

01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	5.72	5.07	Try to think of as an investment of 4yrs or more. Those that panic sell at this point are feeding the sharks! With that being said, the massive run up to ETF getting approved, some whales were buying BTC aggressively and thus created the recent pump a few weeks leading up to announcement. Other traders got involved when fomo kicked in and caused even more momentum. Whales are doing this with intent of selling the “demand” later on, this higher priced BTC. So they short sell the on momentum caused by them and take profits hovering up all those stop losses. The price drops back down to support levels. This is compounded by the main cause : : : which is investors exiting GBTC, both to lock in profits and to shift to cheaper ETFs, creating massive selling pressure. But this transfer of wealth will come to an end soon, and new money will start to flow in front other clients.
01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	6.09	4.48	But they're not passive buyers. They use a toolbox of tactics, including buying directly from OTC players, taking advantage of price discrepancies (Arbitrage), or placing large market orders to snag the necessary Bitcoin themselves. It's a constant dance between satisfying OTC demand and keeping their own reserves healthy. **Why didn’t BTC move on the launch?** Big financial institutions who manage massive portfolios cant just add ETF's to their clients portfolios by chance. It usually takes around 90 days for them to process a new stock. So money pouring into ETF's will likely start to realise around mid april. **Why the recent drop?:** First off, this type of volatility is NORMAL for Bitcoin. So try to ignore the noise if you are new to the Bitcoin space.
01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	6.02	4.35	**So why the optimism?:** Heres the sequence of events were ETF’s are concerned: Blackrock wants to be buyer to fulfil their 1:1 ETF’s pledges >>>putting pressure on the OTC sellers >>>OTC sellers could borrow from other OTC sellers as a backup BTC or they might grab a private loan from Whales to discreetly buy some BTC from the open market, all depending on speed, but its not a guarantee >>>Therefore OTC sellers will need to buy it from exchanges if their availability runs out.
01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	6.06	4.25	We don’t know when. **“Over the counter” OTC’s EXPLAINED:** As a fund manager for Whales or Institutions, its not as simple as buying Bitcoin on Coinbase or another exchange. With this large amount of money involved, you have to be careful how you enter the market. You can't just sell a massive amount of BTC, because it would tank the price AND you can't just buy a massive amount, because the price would rocket up. You always wouldn’t be able to get value from the trades, because the margins would get bigger. So you have to find another way. Rather than go on the open market, OTC allows buyers and sellers to agree in private a price that works for both of them. Hence OTC for large transactions are not floated on exchanges or open markets and don’t directly influence the price. However OTC sellers only have so much available to offer… and larger entities like blackrock will be wanting to buy to fulfil their ETF 1:1 BTC pledges & contracts .
01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	5.95	4.15	Also many funds and corporations have government rules that do not allow them to invest in Bitcoin directly. They can however invest and hold ETFs. Blackrock sells the ETF’s (as an IOU) to institutional investors, which they will need to back on 1:1 basis. Meanwhile Blackrock will get rich on the fees for offering them that window AND the fees will help them purchase even more BTC at OTC prices, from OTC sellers. But when the liquidity pools of OTC sellers become unavailable to trade due to buyers like Blackrock, they will have to turn to Exchanges. Exchanges in turn will HAVE TO buy on the open market eventually if they run out and thus it will start affecting BTC price sometime in the future.
01-28-24 04:37	AtensLight	6.23	4.01	These OTC sellers typically maintain a pool of Bitcoin that they use to facilitate trades. OTC sellers might have limitations on the volume of BTC they can offer at any one point in time and so availability may run out. When an OTC seller runs out of Bitcoin and needs to acquire more there are three paths: Buy BTC directly from Miners / Borrowing some from the other sellers / Buy it from an exchange privately The Exchange maintains a reserve for such a purpose, and they in turn will need to buy more from the open market to fulfil the OTC trade with the seller. These reserves are maintained by users who deposit funds into their platform / Trading fees / Initial coin offerings (ICOs) associated fees. This adds to their reserve funds, which can be used for OTC sales, but they will have to buy from the open market at some point! Exchanges are the middlemen, but even their deep pockets need resupplying. To replenish their Bitcoin reserves, they ultimately rely on the open market.

The recent news highlighting the approval of Bitcoin ETFs suggests an increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment, potentially expanding GBTC's investor base. Despite the positive signs, challenges persist, particularly the "sell-the-news" sentiment post-ETF approval, which has slightly weakened Bitcoin's position, affecting GBTC indirectly. Moreover, the concerns raised by analysts about the potential downsides of making cryptocurrencies more accessible through ETFs may affect investor sentiment. **Published News Impact and Market Sentiment** The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, aiming at long-term investors, indirectly favors GBTC by highlighting the growing legitimacy and attractiveness of cryptocurrency investments.

As of January 26, 2024, GBTC closed at $37.51, marking a 5.84% increase. This analysis dives deep into the technical indicators and fundamental factors influencing GBTC's performance, aiming to provide an informed perspective on its future trajectory. **Technical Analysis** Looking at the technical charts, GBTC has shown a positive momentum, reflected by its recent close at $37.
01-29-24 02:50	stockinvest-us	5.96	4.42	However, the mixed investor reactions to the ETF approvals and the ongoing debate about the ETFs' impact on the cryptocurrency market should be carefully considered. The recent inflow into equity ETFs, despite the overall volatile market, indicates a leaning towards alternative investments, which may include cryptocurrency-related assets like GBTC. **Performance Predictions and Evaluation** For the next trading day and the upcoming week, GBTC is likely to experience heightened volatility due to the broader market's mixed signals and investors digesting the impact of Bitcoin ETFs. The technical indicators, combined with growing acceptance of cryptocurrency investments, suggest a cautious optimism for GBTC's performance. However, investors must remain vigilant of the broader economic indicators and the specific news flow impacting cryptocurrencies and related investment vehicles.

They tend to automatically close at about 5-7 DTE on a favorably trending market. The only maintenance I had to do the entire month (thus far) was rolling out the GLD condor. I probably could have waited until expiration and still hit profit, but I hate holding anything all the way to the end. The position was breached entirely by the spot, and the beauty about rolling these condors out is the leading debit spread covers a TON of the cost of rolling the credit spread, since it's further in the money. I sold the debit spread, rolled the credit spread out by 10 days and down to a 24 delta (collecting a 4 dollar credit in the process) and left the width the same. The only thing to look out for is once the spreads are broken, your collateral increases on that rolled spread so I always have some liquidity available to make it happen.

01-29-24 09:30	Extreme-Brief-8285	5.92	4.69	In his forecasts, Thilen employs the Elliott Wave Theory, which suggests that asset prices move in waves. According to this theory, trends develop in five waves, with the first, third, and fifth being "impulse waves" of the main trend. The others are "retracement waves," signifying a temporary pause in the primary trend. According to Thilen, Bitcoin has been following this "wave" pattern since the beginning of last year, and the recent price drop from $49,000 to $38,500 represents the fourth wave, a temporary retracement. Now, the fifth wave has started, which could lift the Bitcoin price above $52,600. Thilen considers breaking through the $43,000 level an appropriate moment to initiate bullish bets. In his opinion, the rise in the Bitcoin price could be triggered by advertising of exchange-traded BTC funds on Google, overall growth in the stock market, and the cessation of the impact of outflows from the Grayscale fund on the price of the primary cryptocurrency.

Marcus Thilen from 10x Research has allowed for Bitcoin to rise above $52,000 by the end of the first quarter of 2024, as reported by CoinDesk. The analyst, who predicted the recent decline of Bitcoin to $38,000 in mid-January, believes that the slowdown in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the advertising of Bitcoin ETFs on Google may contribute to further growth in the price of the primary cryptocurrency.

Halving is an important function of the Bitcoin protocol and is responsible for the steady pace of new coin creation and its further regulation. A new block in the Bitcoin ecosystem is mined approximately every 10 min, corresponding to 144 blocks per day or approximately 210,000 blocks. It should be noted that the halving of Bitcoin is not controlled by any centralized authority, but occurs automatically in accordance with the program code of the protocol. **How Halving Affects the Price of Bitcoin** The effect of halving on the price of Bitcoin usually causes a lot of discussion among investors and analysts. Several factors can affect the price of Bitcoin as a result of halving: * Limited Supply: As stated earlier, Bitcoin cryptocurrency has a predefined maximum limit of 21 million BTC.

Per Glassnode, outflows from United States exchange Coinbase alone have consistently totaled more than 10,000 BTC per day since the launch of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While balance data shows the impact of corresponding inflows, a trend nonetheless emerges in the second half of the month — outflows and inflows are becoming more balanced, suggesting a cooling of the volatility seen post-ETF launch on Jan. 11. Exchanges’ BTC balances had been rising throughout January, only reversing direction on Jan. 23. Since that date, the trading platforms tracked by Glassnode have become lighter to the tune of 7,400 BTC ($321 million). Whereas the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was sending around $700 million in BTC to Coinbase per day previously, the latest daily outflows totaled less than $200 million.

Often, when I take a short or long position in a pair following a similar trend, but if BTC moves in the opposite direction, my position incurs a loss. I'm struggling to comprehend how to navigate this issue. For instance, if I open a short position in ADAUSDT/DOGEUSDT while both are in a downtrend, but BTC rises, my short positions end up in a loss.

So, after all that context, my proposal is for the community and any willing investor to help build a company in Mexico that will only invest in Mexican bonds. The dividends will be paid back to the investors as either DFI or dBTC, hopefully allowing the investor to choose the kind of payment they will receive as an option. For this to succeed, the idea would be to create a new coin called dMXN. dMXN coins will be backed 1:1 by Mexican pesos invested in a diverse maturity length basket of Mexican bonds. This kind of investment will create a perpetual demand for DFI, which will be a benefit for everyone, including those who are not invested in dMXN. So, in the long term, it can help DeFiChain succeed in its goals.

Reddit was my home for all things cryptocurrency until June of 2022 when I started to listen to Podcasts. This is where the true alpha of crypto is at. These long-form discussions with founders, developers, VCs, and more was an eye opener and education. This is how I went from BTC/ETH to SOL. In April 2022 I became bored of crypto. This was peak bear market. Things were quiet. I kept DCAing, but my goal changed from long term investment to add consistency profitable, while I wait for the long term investment thesis to play out.

Bukele, who has been in office since 2019, has maintained high popularity levels throughout his presidency, a trend that was reflected in pre-election polling where he ledby a signficant margin. His first term was marked by aggressive measures against gang violence, including mass incarcerations, and a notable investment in bitcoin (BTC), setting a precedent for cryptocurrency adoption at a national level.

Ripple, Ether, and Binance Coin — they're basically the party crashers of the crypto world. But here’s where it gets really interesting.

This recovery is reflected in the hashrate reaching a new all-time high of 567 EH/s last week, as reported by Hashrate Index. 2️⃣ Difficulty Adjustment: The latest difficulty adjustment saw a significant increase of 7.34%, setting a record high of 75.5 T. This adjustment, the largest since March 23, 2023, marks the 20th positive adjustment in the past year. 3️⃣ Hashprice Dynamics: The hashprice experienced fluctuations, briefly spiking to $85/PH/day due to a surge in transaction fees from inscription activities.
02-06-24 08:43	LumerinProtocol	5.85	4.62	However, it has since retreated to around $75/PH/day. 4️⃣ ASIC Market: In the ASIC market, the arrival of the new S21s and T21s models in mining farms worldwide suggests continued hashrate growth. This is particularly significant as we approach the Fourth Halving in April. 5️⃣ Mining Market Trends: We've observed a dip in both BTC and USD-denominated hashprice this week. Transaction fees saw an uptick but remained lower than the last quarter of 2023. ASIC prices are showing minor fluctuations, with the next-gen models seeing a slight decrease, new-gen models a slight increase, and mid-gen models experiencing a moderate fall. https://preview.redd.it/42kz1ablq0hc1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79035950e9f75417382d0dcfe98e52716523d408 (https://www.reddit.com/r/LumerinProtocol/comments/1akikki/bitcoin_mining_landscape_btc_hashrate_and/)

Furthermore, they have only added 30 BTC to the treasury since December 31, 2022, representing a growth of 0.33%. * The merger with USBTC has substantially increased the mining hash from 2.6 EH to 7.2 EH. However, since the merger, a total of 1,938 rigs have gone offline, resulting in a decrease in operational mining rigs by 2.61%. Additionally, there has been no change in production sales/treasury growth. * The percentage change in BTC generated indicates issues with network connectivity, mining difficulty, rig inefficiencies, and general operational instability, as explained in monthly media releases.

Although the company did continue to scale mining, they utilized the revenue from it (even breaking the HODL mentality) to fund operating expenses and CC expansion (this was also funded through multiple rounds of dilution via raises). I'm curious if the new CEO, Asher Genoot, will refocus HUT on mining or continue with the current course.
02-07-24 08:26	dafreshprints	5.62	4.79	$RIOT is very cheap right now, and with the ever increasing rumbling about BTC and retail exposure to BTC ETFs, it only makes sense that $RIOT could be looking at a very strong year. Let's talk about the company a little. Some of you might have seen $RIOTs January production update, which admittedly, fell below expectations. The good thing about this is that this news has already settled into the price. Earlier this week, the price fell by 5% before slowly recovering. $RIOT is currently focusing on expanding its infrastructure and completing a second mining facility called Corsicana. The project is aiming to be completed by Q2 of 2024, and it's eventual completion will significantly boost $RIOTs hash rate (bigger hash rate = bigger BTC mining ability).
02-07-24 08:26	dafreshprints	5.81	4.69	If this comes to fruition, $RIOT will be on track to comparable production with BTC mining companies like $MARA. Something that makes me very bullish about $RIOT is the amount of liquidity on hand. They have indicated that they are committed to expanding and upgrading their facilities, and with \ 290m in available liquidity, they have plenty of cash to make this happen. $MARA, for example, only has \ 101m in available liquidity, something that could significantly hamper their ability expand in the future. I know this post is text heavy, and \*\*this is not financial advice\*\*, but I strongly believe $RIOT is going to have strong year and has the potential to blow up. The stock is cheap, volume is low, tremendous amount of shares up for grabs, and as their expansion projects continue and their production scales accordingly, they could see tremendous growth. This, will only be bolstered by all the hype around BTC for 2024. Don't get me wrong, there may be some shortfalls.
02-07-24 08:26	dafreshprints	5.44	4.65	[r/wallstreetbets] A based take on $RIOT.: Let's start with some of the simple stuff. January was a terrible month for BTC mining companies. Across the board, almost all affected companies are down \ 30% YTD. $RIOT is down 35%. This is good news, the stock is cheap. But why did this happen? A lot of different factors, the biggest being false expectations relating to the emergence of BTC ETFs. If you look at December 2023, $RIOT was ripping, and why is that? Because the rumors were brewing about BTC ETFs were brewing. As with any big change in the market, it takes time for the dust to settle. People expected ETF approvals to cause BTC to rocket, but just because something was approved doesn't mean retail investors would flock. There were many reasons for retail investors to still be uncertain, and in some cases, their institutions simply restricted access to the ETFs. But now it's been almost a month, and things are finally starting to take hold: [https://www.
02-07-24 08:26	dafreshprints	5.92	4.50	The BTC halving may very well cause BTC's price to dip heavily before it picks up again in the late summer, as price actions related to halving's usually lag by several months. This could also affect $RIOT. But if I had to call, I see $RIOT trading comfortable around $25 EOY. This is more bullish than recent analyst predictions, but I think it's reasonable. https://preview.redd.it/d97x2pe4s7hc1.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ddedef21c190d14e79c8508a9b957c1d21251ed As always, DYOR, but right now might be a good time to buy.

There's not doubt that retail exposure is going to continue to grow, as market rumblings about the BTC halving and potential for huge growth 2024 propagate. The effects of this article are already being felt today, as $RIOT is up 3.15%. Now, you might say that's a small number, and it is. But you have to consider the volume that is being traded: [Volume](https://preview.redd.it/brwgw5ulo7hc1.jpg?width=889&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c70df22e3717b12e452ac28726916b7ed4bd078d) With a 3-month average volume of 29m, these numbers are chump change, and that's great news.

02-08-24 06:04	jellyfishezie	6.03	4.61	[r/BCGAME] Everything You Need To Know About Ethereum 2.0: After the popularly known Bitcoin (BTC), which can be referred to be the father of crypto-currencies, comes Ethereum. By market capitalisation, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency with a decentralised open-source blockchain that supports smart contract functionality.  ### What is Ethereum? It is important to note that beyond just the crypto idea that spans our knowledge about Bitcoin, Ethereum is more of a software platform that syncs between a decentralised internet and a decentralised app store. Since any entity per se does not control it, a system like this requires some sort of currency to pay for the computational resources required to run these programs. This crypto-currency is known as Ether (ETH).  So, in essence, Ether, in turn, operates as a digital currency and, at the same time, a drive for the decentralised apps within the network.

Analysts are eyeing the halving event, but let's talk about the real stars of the show—three tokens that could potentially yield 10X growth in the coming bull run. 1. Landshare (LAND): At the forefront of real estate tokenization, Landshare is making property investment more accessible. With three successful tokenized property sales and a current market cap that seems modest at $5 million, $LAND is showing signs of significant undervaluation. At $1.2 now and with tokenization trends heating up, hitting its ATH of $12 could mean a 10X leap! 2. Uniswap (UNI): In the wake of exchange controversies, DEXs like Uniswap are gaining traction.

Net inflows to spot bitcoin ETFs surged to nearly $9 billion amid the cryptocurrency's price surge. Bloomberg data reveals that inflows hit $405 million, marking the third-largest total since the SEC approved these products in January. However, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust GBTC experienced outflows of over $101 million, continuing its losing streak. & Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart commented on the significant inflow day, highlighting that eight out of ten ETFs that began trading in January attracted investment. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) officially became the second fund to cross $3 billion in AUM, following BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). & Despite these outflows, ETFs focused on the crypto space, such as Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), have been performing well, with BITQ up more than 16% in the past week.
02-10-24 02:22	bitcounts	6.17	4.44	& Bitcoin itself has been on a surge, recently trading at $47,800, up almost 6% in the past 24 hours and over 10% in the last seven days, reaching its highest level since early January. & With the positive sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, some analysts predict it could top $50,000, marking a fresh yearly high. The recent uptick in BTC and other risk-on assets coincides with upbeat earnings from companies like ARM Holdings Plc and Nvidia Corp. & While the post-ETF approval slump in Bitcoin was attributed to factors like the unwinding of prepositioning and market dynamics, analysts believe these trends have stabilized. As the market regains momentum, Bitcoin's rally continues to capture attention. & Exciting times lie ahead for Bitcoin enthusiasts as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve and attract significant investment.
02-10-24 03:19	SoupaSoka	6.51	4.75	[r/Bitcoin] Gold's value and BTC's value should be thoughtfully compared: I'll start by saying that I expect BTC's value to increase notably over the next ten years, somewhere between 3x and 10x. I think the ETFs will play a big hand in this rise. In addition, I hold no gold or gold ETF shares and don't really believe in it as a worthwhile store of value or speculative investment. Despite this, I think people, especially users here with many of us being like-minded, need to be cautious about comparing the increase in gold's value after the gold spot ETF launches with what will happen with BTC's price following the BTC spot ETF launches.
02-10-24 03:19	SoupaSoka	6.32	4.66	Gold's spot ETFs launching around 2004 predates the massive rise in the smart phone market as well as modern computing in general. Modern electronic demand accounts for around 7.5% of all gold demand. On top of that, jewelry accounts for around 40-50% of gold demand (source: https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gold-demand-trends-q2-2022). Gold also has a reported "store of value" use case and a hedge against inflation, similar to what supporters of BTC would argue exists for BTC. My point here being, gold has many real-world use cases beyond BTC's use cases, and the ones that BTC has, gold shares (albeit not identically). I am not advising anyone to invest or not invest in gold or BTC, but merely want to mention that we shouldn't blindly believe the BTC spot ETFs will impact BTC price to the same degree that it is believed gold ETFs did for gold. Happy to hear opinions on this. (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1anhchs/golds_value_and_btcs_value_should_be_thoughtfully/)

02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	5.98	4.57	) If I were to use **Kucoin** to trade the default fees are **0.1%** for each buy or sell transaction, meaning that I would pay **0.2% ‘roundtrip’** for one complete grid step transaction. If I were to set my steps **0.3% apart**, I would get lots of transactions but I’d be paying two thirds of my profit to Kucoin and that is obviously not what I want to do. I typically aim for **\ 1%-ish** on average between steps but you should evaluate the fees you pay and set this according to your personal preference. I will give an example of how I might set this up below. **\*\*\* Feb 2024 note on grid step spacing \*\*\*** Binance.us currently has a tiered pair fee structure in which **BTC/USDC** is considered tier 0. Tier 0 pays absolutely no transaction fees whatsoever and in this way represents a unique opportunity for a grid trade using small steps. I mentioned at the very beginning of this document that I am actively trading BTC/USDC – I bet you can’t guess where I’m doing that!
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	6.01	4.42	us It took me a long time to make my original example graphics which were made using 3commas and Gate. In the interest of historical context and my own time I have elected to use the originals and refrain from creating new images. You should be able to figure out the logistics of using another grid trading option based on the context given in these examples. There is also one extremely dated **ADA/USD** example in this article. Will **ADA/USD** ever return to the spot price it had reached when I made the example? I don’t fucking know, but the graphics and underlying principals remain and therefore I will leave them in. The grid trading tool I currently use is **Bitsgap** As a disclaimer of personal investment I actively run this type of trade on **BTC/USDC** as of Feb 2024.
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	5.83	4.40	The gist of it is that smaller grid steps result in more transactions on pairs with lower volatility, but lower overall profits on pairs with higher volatility. On BTC/USDC I use smaller steps (in terms of percentage of spot price) than I would on ARB/USDC because ARB/USDC is usually much more volatile than BTC/USDC. **\*\*\* End Feb 2024 note on grid spacing \*\*\*** **Advanced tip grid spacing tip**: The actual number of buy points or sell points is one fewer than whatever you put here, because the bottom point will be a buy-only point and the top point will be a sell-only point. If I use ten grid steps I will see all ten steps on my grid visually. There will be nine buy points and nine sell points, with the middle eight of those ten points being both buy and sell points, the top one being sell only and the bottom one being buy only. It’ll make more sense when we get into an example. **Total investment** – this is the amount you want to use for the grid trade, measured in the righthand coin in your pair.
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	5.98	4.39	If I was trading **BTC/USD** my investment would be measured in **USD**. There are some other settings you might see as well. In this example I made using 3commas there is an option called **quantity per grid**. This setting will be autofilled when you fill in the total investment section. It refers to the amount of the lefthand coin bought or sold at each grid step and can be filled in manually but it’s usually a lot quicker to just fill in the total investment field. Here’s a picture of a sample grid trade on **ADA/USD** that assumes that **ADA** is currently priced around $2.10 (**\*\*\* 2024 me doesn't know if ADA will ever return to $2.10!**) Note that these are not values I would use for an actual grid trade, I just use them here because it will make my examples easier to read.
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	6.39	4.34	’ It is often conducted with a crypto/stablecoin or crypto/fiat pair like **BTC/USDT** or **ADA/EUR** but there are other non-fiat crypto pairs some exchanges offer as well that will work well with this strategy. To set up a grid trade you start by picking a coin pair to trade. As I mentioned it's common to use a unit of **fiat** or a **stablecoin** as the righthand asset in a pair but you can also use **ETH**, **BTC** or any other coin/token your exchange of choice allows as a righthand currency. The lefthand asset can be anything you want to trade. More volatility in a pair is good for grid trades. For simplicity I am going to use **USD** as the righthand currency in all of my examples in this document, though this is certainly not the only way to show profits using this strategy.
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	6.43	4.28	In Feb 2024, I have the most faith in BTC as an asset (and I can trade it for free) so I only run grids on BTC/USDC. I don't really recommend shitcoins in general although they are very popular with grid traders on sites that offer lower cap coins like Kucoin and Gate and the potential for high returns paid in the righthand asset of your grid pair is extreme. If you are a gambler, have fun and be safe. Please also keep in mind that past returns don’t necessarily equal future returns! # TLDR As you can imagine I can’t really summarize this up. If you are still reading, good luck on your grids! If you just scrolled to the bottom, sorry! I know this is a wall of text but it summarizes everything I’ve learned about this type of trade and hopefully people get some use out of it. (https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1annkgm/how_to_crypto_301_grid_trading/)
02-10-24 08:01	MalletSwinging	6.06	4.03	In fact, one of the more interesting ways to use this type of tool is to trade any other coin against **BTC** or **ETH** because then you can completely cut fiat out of the equation and just trade two cryptocurrencies based on their strength vs each other. A grid trade has a few **parameters** to set up. Most of the available tools will do this for you through a suggested settings or AI settings option, though I personally prefer to set them myself because the computed values typically only represent what has already happened and not what is likely to happen based on news or upcoming market momentum in either direction.

02-11-24 08:46	kirillborisov	5.04	4.86	[r/Bitcoin] Possible catastrophic scenarios: Don't know if this was posted before, but let's consider possible disastrous scenarios for the Bitcoin blockchain. Namely, these: 1. There is a sudden collapse of the US (Chinese, European, etc.) economy (or any other economic event, bad enough for the people and companies alike). Most BTC holders (or the major ones, to that extent) would like to bail out and start fireselling their coins. They literally need to sell, or they die. 2. There is a major disruption of the Internet on a physical level, making it two or more smaller "internets", physically separated from each other. This continues for 3-6 months, or just indefinitely. UPDATE: this one is discussed here: [](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin/comments/1aneuum/what_happens_to_btc_if_a_big_part_of_the_internet/) 3. There is a nuclear attack on a few major cities. Coincidentally, these are also the BTC mining centers. The 50-75% of the hash power is gone in a second.
02-11-24 08:46	kirillborisov	5.94	4.52	4. There is a major natural disaster that makes BTC mining impossible (with the current hashrate and power requirements). Major BTC farmers stop working. The hashrate drops to the levels we've witnessed in 2011-2013. 5. The advances in AI, LLM and machine learning enable more profitable use of the current ASICs. In other words, you are much better of MLing than mining. The trend is just setting, but the profits seem lucrative, and the major miners are inclined to move into this field. UPDATE: mining ASICs cannot be repurposed, only the electricity and housing can. Let us discuss the possible implications of each scenario on the Bitcoin blockchain and the BTC price in particular.

With a staggering $3.2 billion in year-to-date inflows, IBIT has quickly climbed to become one of the top five ETFs of 2024, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. This achievement places IBIT in the league of mammoth index ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and Vanguard 500 Index Fund ETF (VOO), highlighting the growing interest in Bitcoin among investors. https://preview.redd.it/44qrarl5cyic1.png?width=1112&format=png&auto=webp&s=38e19421513d390162610c4d9bd0ae6582b17a43 ## Fidelity's Spot ETF Makes Top 10 Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also secured a spot in the top 10 ETF asset gatherers of the year, with $2.7 billion in inflows, showcasing the broadening appeal of Bitcoin-related investment products.

However, as seen above, the 898,470 addresses that acquired 509,330 BTC at an average price of $46,400 could mount a support buy-wall. In a bearish reversal, frantic covering purchases from those investors could inadvertently trigger a rebound.

02-16-24 05:04	zhenleal	5.79	4.85	[r/CryptoCoinsIndia] Bitcoin sees $1.6b disappears from exchanges; here’s what it means for BTC’s price: BTC price peaked at $52,858 on Feb. 15, bringing its monthly gains to 24.3%, an unusual trend in Bitcoin exchange flows suggests more dramatic action could follow. Bitcoin price has entered a new 2024 peak in the last four days, dating back to Feb. 12. Investors shifted $1.6 billion in Bitcoin into long-term storage Thanks to heightened buying pressure from investors piling funds into the newly launched spot ETFs, Bitcoin has added over $200 billion to its market capitalization within the first half of February.
02-16-24 05:04	zhenleal	5.88	4.63	Price Bitcoin (BTC) Price Exchange Reserves vs. Price | Source: CryptoQuant Essentially, such a massive decline in exchange reserves means a lot less supply of BTC is now available to be traded on exchanges. Albeit temporary, this often positively impacts short-term price action for several reasons. Firstly, it signals that most investors are angling for future gains rather than loading up their exchange wallets in hopes of exploring short-term selling opportunities at current peak prices. More importantly, the relative scarcity created by the dwindling market supply leads to an accelerated price upswing with every new wave of demand. With Bitcoin ETF sponsors on a buying spree, this bullish catalyst will likely drive BTC price toward the $60,000 milestone in the days ahead.
02-16-24 05:04	zhenleal	5.54	4.58	However, looking beyond the flashy headlines and record-breaking fund inflows, critical on-chain data trends suggest the rally may be far from over. CryptoQuant’s exchange reserves metric tracks real-time changes in the number of BTC coins currently deposited on crypto exchanges and trading platforms. As depicted in the chart, Bitcoin exchange reserves stood at 2.1 million BTC on Jan. 25. But that figure has now declined by 31,255 BTC to hit just over 2 million BTC when writing on Feb. 15. Valued at the current price of $52,000, this implies that $1.6 billion worth of BTC has disappeared from exchanges as investors increasingly opt for long-term storage. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Exchange Reserves vs.
02-16-24 05:04	zhenleal	5.66	4.45	Forecast: Can Bitcoin price reach $60,000? In summary, the induced market scarcity from the decline of $1.6 billion exchange reserves puts the BTC price in a prime position for another leg-up toward $60,000. However, in the short term, the bullish traders face a major roadblock in the $55,500 area. IntoTheBlock’s in/out of the money (GIOM) data groups existing BTC holders according to their historical buy-in prices. It depicts that 462,640 addresses have acquired 228,000 BTC at the minimum price of $55,595. This cluster of holders could mount a roadblock if they book some profits as Bitcoin approaches its break-even price. However, if the bulls can stage a decisive breakout above that $55,500 resistance, a $60,000 retest could be on the cards as predicted.

02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	6.38	4.68	### Greater Game Variety Gamblers at Bitcoin casinos enjoy a superb variety of games with a fantastic player margin that ensures all-round satisfaction. Some sites are known to provide payouts as much as 99%, and many are adding a wider choice of table games such as Roulette and Blackjack, and their variants. Bitcoin also has a great Player Return Percentage and is currently much improved when compared to traditional online gambling sites. The casino houses who offer BTC as a payment method, have also improved their live game experience for their players to ensure that it is more immersive and interactive.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	6.27	4.58	Additionally, these gambling platforms offer very attractive promotional offers to lure players from traditional online casinos to their own. ### Offer More Value With the value of Bitcoin soaring globally, more and more gamblers are beginning to transact using cryptocurrencies. This gives gamblers a remarkable advantage when using BTC. Upon playing at on crypto site, they can choose to continue gambling with their existing Bitcoin credit and wait for the crypto prices to increase before cashing out. Furthermore, they can withdraw their high-flying digital currency and exchange it for another currency of their choice at a much more attractive rate.

There are many incredible advantages to using these types of platforms to enjoy hours of entertainment in a safe and secure environment. With the digital age transforming at breakneck speed, it only makes sense to move with the times and embrace crypto as a genuine means to transact.

02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	6.22	4.51	Comments from first-hand users are especially telling as they give you honest insight into the operations of the casino. If you find a pattern of negative comments, it is a clear sign that you should explore another site. ### Online Gaming License Although an online gaming license is not always required, it is helpful for a Bitcoin casino to have one to create peace of mind for their clients. The online gaming license makes it legal for the platform to operate. Some BTC gambling sites are licensed through countries like Costa Rica and Curacao, and may not offer full protection for their players. Players who want added protection must look for providers who are licensed through trusted jurisdictions such as the UK, Isle of Man, and Malta.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	5.74	4.49	### Added Convenience Many countries across the globe have not legalized online gambling. Banks in these countries, therefore, do not make provision for transactions on the gambling platforms. However, if you have access to BTC, this can be bypassed, allowing you to tender using the crypto. Essentially, gamblers who play on a Bitcoin casino can eliminate the risk of possibly registering at illegal gambling sites because of their location. BTC is a convenient method for players to access legal gambling platforms purely because they can transact legally. Additionally, players have full access to their winnings with the ability to deposit or withdraw from their casino house accounts anywhere in an instant.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	6.71	4.45	Always look out for providers that use NetEnt, MicroGaming, and Pay’n Go as these are reputable online casino software providers. ### Highlight Provably Fair Gaming One unique feature of BTC gambling platforms is Provably Fair games such as Bitcoin Dice. Not all casinos that accept BTC offer Provably Fair games, so they must make a special effort to create a unique product for their players. Provably Fair games give players the power to manually verify the authenticity and fairness of the game results. This incredible feature creates transparency for the site and illustrates to their players that the games are not rigged. https://preview.redd.it/v95c53lnyijc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eab7ddc1534f5d72a02a7358c9a951bb291185f ## BTC Casino Features For new players to make an informed decision when choosing a platform to play on, they must analyze the following features. ### Player Restrictions Players must ensure that there are no inherent restrictions to playing at that Bitcoin casino.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	5.89	4.37	### Improved Transparency Traditional casinos have developed a poor reputation for concealing critical information from their clients, such as potential winnings. Furthermore, they tend to use obscure methods that give the house hidden advantages, which many gamblers are unaware of. Many players may find that they continue to incur losses with any reasonable explanation, and traditional sites may take advantage of their circumstances. On the other hand, BTC gambling sites aim to provide clarity and transparency amongst their players to eradicate the unscrupulous methods that traditional casinos employ. This transparency is evident by clearly ensuring that the odds are legitimate and explicit to gamblers. It encourages more openness and forms a mutually rewarding relationship between the house and its players.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	6.69	4.36	Many gamblers choose to use their smartphones or tablets when gambling online, and, therefore, the software on the platform should be optimized for use on Android, iOS, PC, and Mac devices. https://preview.redd.it/9v0szh0myijc1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ef9fb68e1c5fe76365ac8341bc9d03e2c750f8 ### Bonus and Promotion Offerings In order to attract and retain players, platforms should offer meaningful incentives such as bonuses and promotions to ensure that people play. Attractive Welcome Bonuses and regular No Deposit bonuses will work wonders in setting Bitcoin casinos above their non-crypto currency competitors. Players must have a reason to stay at the casino and continue playing. Many players who use BTC are particularly fond of playing Slots, and so Free Spins would be a very exciting type of bonus to keep them satisfied.
02-19-24 12:10	jellyfishezie	5.85	4.05	### Lowered House Fees Traditional gambling sites further add to their players’ discomfort by adding exuberant costs that are attached to transactions and deposits on their platforms. This is over and above the various duties and taxes that may be deducted on a player’s winnings as well. BTC sites have almost obliterated these costs, as all of their transactions incur either extremely low or zero fees. They also have an advantage in that they are non-regulated by any payment services or institutions, and this, in turn, enables them to facilitate cheaper transactions for their players. Gamblers are attracted to platforms that offer low withdrawal fees and deposit costs, and this is where using crypto to play can work as an advantage for the players.

He still thinks word-of-mouth is the best form of advertisement. SMH A few people have made Thousands of dollars off of ROY, but that should turn into Hundreds of thousands or maybe even millions! Now we all know that More players = More money that Roy will be worth. Roy used to be worth like $0.13, then it plummeted. Then it pumped a tiny but recently, because BTC and crypto in general - is trending. But it didnt become worth more than $0.01 like a lot of us hoped. This is a great game, and it can definitely be worth way more money like it used to be. So lets just come together and think of the EASIEST ways to spread the word about this game! Im ready to actually be rich off this game some day!

Post OpEx could cause more volatility in the stock market from profit-taking and less hedging from market makers. (e.g. SMCI) AAPL, GOOG, MSFT are showing a sign of weakness, and AMZN, META, and NVDA are losing momentum. Sector rotation is happening (XLK, XLC, XLY / XLV, XLB, XLP, XLI). VIX is riding the 10/20 MAs. Market breadth is mixed. It's not getting better, but also it's not getting worse either. This week's price action is pivotal. CNN fear and greed index: Extreme greed \- DXY: Bullish. Finding support on the 10 MA. The channel is intact. \- 10Y: Bullish. At a major resistance. All the MAs are turning upwards and no sign of divergence yet. \- BTC: Bullish. Overbought on the weekly and the daily.
